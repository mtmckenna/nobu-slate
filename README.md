No Budget Movie Slate for iOS (iPhone and iPad)

Swipe left or right to slate. Swipe up or down on the scene/take/audio file to
auto increment/decrement the field.

This iOS app was designed to present just the most pertinent information required
when shooting a movie with a secondary audio source. The fields presented
are the following:

* Scene number
* Take number
* Audio file name
* Left/right audio channel labels
* Production name
* Date/time

Screenshots:

After swiping horizontally, a countdown starts. A pulse sound is played and the slate
flashes colors so that external audio can be matched to the video:

After the countdown ends, the app flashes as in the screenshot below, and a nother
sound is played to help match audio/video:
